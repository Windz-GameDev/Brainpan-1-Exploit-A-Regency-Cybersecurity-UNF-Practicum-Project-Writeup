# Brainpan-1-Exploit-A-Regency-Cybersecurity-UNF-Practicum-Project-Writeup

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description:

In this writeup, we perform a Buffer Overflow Exploit on the Brainpan 1 Machine on the TryHackMe website. This was an introductory project to pentesting and ethical hacking to help me better understand buffer overflows, become more familiar with Linux, and reverse engineering of programs. I'd like to thank everyone at Regency who supported me during this project, specifically my team John Aff and Solomon Ebadi, as well as everyone else at Regency who came to see my presentation.  All the resources I used to assist me with this writeup will be listed in this readme, and referenced throughout the guide, which can be downloaded in the section below as a PDF. If anyone has any feedback or questions for me, please let me know, I am eager to learn and improve, and I hope you find this write up useful and informative.
